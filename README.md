# Sunlight Intensity 

Add sunlight intensity to your Home Assistant dashboards and automations with this integration. **Sunlight Intensity** provides a percentage for each of your propertyâ€™s walls, based on the suns direction (Azimuth).

As the Sun moves around your house, each wall sensor will display a percentage of how much sunlight is on that wall. When the sun is at 90Â° to a wall, the entity will be at 100%.

Additional sensors:

* [Sun Elevation angle](https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/elevation-angle)
* [Sun Azimuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_azimuth_angle)


# Usage and Automation Ideas

ðŸ¤–:  Close Blinds at rear of house when Back Wall Intensity reaches 80%
 
ðŸ¤–:  Turn on Fan when Right Wall Intensity exceeds 50%
 
ðŸŒž:  Know when your solar panels will reach peak production.

# Installation

**Sun Intensity** can be installed via HACS or by copying the sun-intensity folder to the [custom_components](https://github.com/urbanframe/sun-intensity/tree/main/custom_components/sun_intensity) folder within Home Assistant.

# Configuration

Configuration requires the longitude, latitude and rotation of your property. This information can be obtained from [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com).

In Google Earth change the latitude and longitude format to decimal within the settings.

The latitude and longitude can be seen in the bottom right hand corner. Ensure your coridinates are positive or negative nubers with the table below.

|Coordinate|Bearing|Decimal|
|-|-|-|
|Latitude|N|Positive|
|Latitude|S|Negative|
|Longitude|E|Positive|
|Longitude|W|Negative|


Eg, 51.501079Â°N 0.142612Â°W would be:
* Latitude: 51.501079
* Longitude: -0.142612


Using the measure tool, draw a line parallel with the sides of your property from the rear to the front. The rotation will be displayed as the heading in the measure toolbox.
